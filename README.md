# React Hello World App
[**Try it out here!!**](http://react-hello-world-app.surge.sh/ "http://react-hello-world-app.surge.sh/")

----

My first React app.
Using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

Based on a great series of tutorials called [Learning React With Create-React-App](https://medium.com/in-the-weeds/learning-react-with-create-react-app-part-1-a12e1833fdc) by [Brandon Richey](https://twitter.com/diamondgfx)

Deployed using Surge following this [simple tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089 "Surge VS GitHub Pages: How to deploy a create-react-app project") helpfully suggested by [Nikki L.R.](https://twitter.com/nikkilr88)

It's a simple app that allows the user to add/remove `Hello` components and type the name to be greeted. It also allows to change the 'hello' to Spanish or Lebanese style salutes.
